# A flexible EM-like clustering algorithm for noisy data

This repository contains the code that implements the clustering algorithm corresponding to the paper (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1907.01660.pdf).  

## Algorithm

The clustering algorithm is implemented as a function in `EM_CG.py` and it can called

```
